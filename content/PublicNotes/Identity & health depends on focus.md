- [[HT focus]]

- Why
	- Society and experiences will change you but not necessarily in the best way because they're not made to do it

- who you surround with
	- surround yourself with people that already got what you want, with similar mindset or abilities that may synergyze with you
- what you consume
	- consume content that incentivize and help you achieve your goals even if you don't take action because it fills your brain with related thoughs
