- [Article worthy answer](https://www.skool.com/adonis-gang/fapping-60bd37b6?p=48609e9c)
	- v1
		I understand that my answer is article worthy for how long it is, but I think I've got something valuable to share for you. Because I like to talk about this problem I'll try to explain myself as best as I can.
		
		"I personally believe that this is caused due to a lack of identity" and your best current solution is affirmations?
		
		The funny part is that you probably know one of the biggest problems. The bad part is that you seem really bad about solving it.
		
		People suggested many tactics but I think that the principles and fundamentals are much more important to know first.
		
		Your life needs a fundation to grow from. Overlook it and you'll fall without even knowing why. To me, the fundamentals are: introspection, health, wealth and relationships. You already think there's a problem about introspection, I'll help you understand *how* to grow on this and, *why* it's important:
		
		) You can't distract yourself from a bad habit without knowing what to do instead.
		
		) You can't change your identity without thinking about it, you'll stay the same.
		
		) You can't have focus without clarity of intents, you'll be the greatest at someone else's game.
		
		) You can't find your problems and solutions if you're not clear about who you are.
		
		Why should you have clarity on your goals?
		
		To create a distraction from the bad side of ourself. Our bad habits, monkey brain desires, and daemons won't reach you as easily.
		
		Because you change with time you should think about who you are multiple times. For the rest of your life.
		
		Who you are without clear goals? Without knowing *what* you need (vision), *why* you need it (purpose), and *how* to achieve it (mission), someone else will answer these questions for you.
		
		* Journal about these topics and you'll understand how to solve your problems your own way.
		
		Personally, I started from the *why* I might or I might not want to achieve a goal. I'll list the main topics:
		
		- Values
		    
		- Principles
		    
		- Belief systems (religions, philosophies etc)
		    
		- Past experiences evaluation (understanding negative and positive patterns in your life)
		    
		
		There are many more topics about the *why*, search them. I'll give you some clarity only about what "the most valuable" 2 are.
		
		Values
		
		- It's about tradeoffs, not just "what you like". If you put something at the first place, you would make sacrifices with anything below. It's the same for the second, third etc
		    
		- It's prioritization that acts as a filter for your problems, distractions and solutions
		    
		
		E.g. If I put freedom at the first place I would not be uncertain about having a girlfriend or not. it's a priority for me to achieve freedom, if having a girlfriend would give me too many tradeoffs to deal with, I won't search her.
		
		Principles
		
		- Your own mental models or essential ways and guidelines to solve your problems
		    
		- You made them based on the most important informations you found in your life
		    
		- You're emotionally attached to these
		    
		- You read, remember and update them
		    
		
		E.g. What's the Most Important Thing? (MIT). Answer, take action and extensively integrate it to your life to feel fulfilled. If you really think it's too simple then why your actions doesn't reflect it? why are you reading this?
		
		I think that we underestimate ourselves on how capable are we to solve our own problems.
		
		That's just the start. Remember that other than your purpose you still need to grow on *what* you want and *how* to get it.
		
		Introspection it's a journey that anyone is going through consciously or subconsciously. It's a basic but fundamental step for great success in life.
		
		I hope this informations it's going to be valuable to you as much as it did to me. If you want to talk about anything like this I'd love to do it.
		
		Have a great day.
