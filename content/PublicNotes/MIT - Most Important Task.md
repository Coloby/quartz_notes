- Excuses
	- No motivation now - I work better when I want to work
		- Drive is usually never enough to accomplish goals but discipline may ignite it even when we feel like "It's not the right time of the day"
		- It's true but even w that you would like to work much less that is needed for you to get what you want so discipline is needed anyway
	- hard day Yesterday/Today, I can't take it
		- means that you didn't do the MIT before doing the shallow work and now you'll need more discipline to get in track in the same day
	- Need more rest
		- if you've logically selected your rest type and period it's most likely that you're scared of starting again rather that you didn't rest properly
		- if the "more rest" means shallow rest then that's a good indication that you're just scared
