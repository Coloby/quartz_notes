- Why? - [To remember and think better](https://youtu.be/--Hu2w0s72Y?t=1682)
- Prerequisite: [[Productivity]]

- How we store memory 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230613224745.png]]
- Tidy library framework
	- Contextual
		- consuming content - pay attenction to...
			- storytelling
			- design
			- graphichs and vfxs
			- patterns of positive & negatives
			- influencing
				- why is this interesting?
				- are the actors related to influencing?
		- reading
			- Solo taxonomy - prefer extended abstract
				- integrate new knowledge into old knoledge
				- don't just write into the note of the book itself
			- don't read in a linear way - [[Prestudy]]
				- Book are tools, we use them, not the opposite
		- taking notes
			- Only after higher level learning
			- [Don't offload too quickly](https://youtu.be/Mvxbl7Iwep4?t=156)
				- Note unwanted burden away like details, but not if your working memory is capable of retaining it while using [[Higher level learning]] and cognitive load to preocess it futher
			- [type or write, but do it relationally,](https://youtu.be/Mvxbl7Iwep4?t=429) [not lineary](https://youtu.be/NF9rwQxsD1w?t=2170)
		- [[HT new language]]
	 1. Mentality - AFA
		- Approach - [[Learning methods]]
		- Filter - [[HT research]]
		- Arrange - [[Prestudy]]
	2. Process - encoding w cognitive load - BIS
		- [[Bloom's principles]] - [[Predicting]] & [[Chunking]] to bigger picture & past ideas
		- [[Inquiry learning]]
		- [[Study techniques]]
	3. Pull - [[Retrieval-Revision techniques]]
	
	- Analogy
		- Info are books
		- shelfs are needed to categorize the books
		- The way you arrange the books into the shelfs and in the library itself is encoding
		- You use retrieval to find a book in a specific shelf
	- archived 
		- old1
			- Chose where to get info trough [[Cone of learning]]
			- [[Prestudy]]
			1. Where to put info for optimal retrieval?
				- Evaluating and [[Chunking]] it to the bigger picture and past knowledge.
			2. How to write it for better encoding?
				- Cognitive load is used to enhance encoding often with [[Bloom's principles]] supplemented with [[Inquiry learning]] and personal [[Study techniques]]
				- Always be concise and clear

- semi usefull vocabs
	- deep processing - the product of higher order learning
	- synthesizing - like evaluating in the [[Bloom's principles]]
- fonti utili
