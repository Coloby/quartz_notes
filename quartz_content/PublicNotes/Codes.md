		- Parts of coding that will be automated? what to do?
			- my future vision of automation in web dev
				- Do you know the preview mode on next js? 
				- I think that in the future you'll be able to make & modify a website with kinda the same interface and a chat to make the bot construct the website
			- Where to focus?
				- *Mix* so many skills that you become irreplacable
				- [[Architecture-Infra codes]] 
					- scalability
					- Backend & APIs
				- [[DBs]]
				- [[Networking - Hacking]]
			- Will AI fk us?
				- Why LLMs may substitute or help junior web devs but hardly more than this
					- Project needs are ever evolving as the tech that it uses it will be hard for LLMs to stay up to date and make reasonable changes without supervision. 
					- Esclusively trusting an LLM to make important decision won't be common anyway
				- That's why understanding the overall idea will be needed. 
				- Humans are not perfect but machines neither.
