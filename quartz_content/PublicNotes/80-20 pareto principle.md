- what? - 80% of results are made of 20% of possible causes, most stuff is noise
- how?
	- Say no to any non essential stuff
		- Without actively saying no to things we may be forced to do them
			- going to school while you're logically better off without it
		- Someone invite you in a date and you say yes while you don't even want new friends or something else
	- Account *tradeoffs* even in great opportunities
		- e.g.
			- what we put focus on
			- the tools we use
			- the people we surround with
			- the thoughts we choose to embody
	- 80% of our stuff is garbage but share it anyway to find the 20%
	-
	- See errors by a long term view, almost nothing will be important
	- If value < 90% compared to criterias, don't choose it
		- If it's not an "hell yeah" then it's a "no"
		- e.g.
			- the interviewee would be an 8 but not a 9 or 10... don't choose him
