- Manifest 3 vs 2
	- used to define metadata about the extension, permissions, scripts, css etc
	- can be in the chrome store but v2 not
		- v2 is gonna be deprecated and chronium based browsers will follow (brave...)
	- you can do less stuff in general than v2
	- considered a regression by many
		- [fakes to be privacy and security oriented because of a conflict of interest](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening)
		- enables privacy oriented extensions to be less capable instead of enhancing review process for anti-privacy extensions
		- excuses poposed
			- better privacy and security trough lowering capabilities
			- better performance
- In case you suffer from memory loss :D
	- If you choose to add the popup 
		- what? when you click extension ico a little window appear
		-
		- background script or service worker
			- let code run in the background and everything you write there will act like if it's in the popup and NOT in the webpage
		- content script
			- it's connected to the current webpage so if you do a querySelector the results should be expected
		- *some commands/APIs works only in certain types of scripts*
			- bkgr or content
			- so beware to check if that API should be used there or there
			- you need to communicate between different types of scripts with different methods to solve this
