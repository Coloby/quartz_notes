- What?
	- Way of thiking focussed on the practical outcomes, problem-solving, and rejecting anything abstract or principle based that doesn't bring any tangible results.
		- versatile
			- it doesn't need empiric truths or abstractions necessary
		- accessible
			- it's scope it's general and not limited to scientific research etc.
	- Similar to:
		- [[Scientific method]] 
			- almost identyc (instead of solutions, hypothesis are used)
			- more versatile & accessible 
		- [[First principle thinking]] 
			- without the focus on almost re-inventing the wheel
			- more versatile & accessible

- Why? - to grow in any field or to upgrade a process
- How?
	1. *Observe* trough SOC framework: 
		1. Situation - identify problems to overcome and it's causes
		2. Outcomes - why and how?
		3. Contex - limitations and resources avability.
	2. *[[Predicting]] Solutions and tests* to get valuable feedback trough KPIs
	3. *Evaluate feedback* changing solutions & tests to find a solution
		- outcomes can be influeced by factors beyond one's control thus are not strictly correlated to the quality of the conclusion
- E.g.
	- [[Law of actraction]]
	- Believing in something just because makes you strongher or it's practical - [fonte](https://youtu.be/S93jMOqF-oE?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR)
		- With dangers to take into account
			- you can't cure depression like this - [Andrew Tate](https://youtu.be/VGWGcESPltM?t=2795).
				- prevent the problem, don't avoid it
					- It may be a good coping mechanism only with equilibrate relianace. A way to still incorporate this is making a list of red flags that when flagged it would encourage the individual to seek help. 
				- risking lifes on a low percentage cure rate tool is bad
					- Even though pragmatism may cure the clynically depressed guy we're risking him to relapse and suicide while there could be taken a different approach that may have led to the same result but at least it was considered the best option with the best probability of success. That's why pragmatism should not be used to prevent or cure clynical depression but rather as a plus added to standard procedures made by professionals
