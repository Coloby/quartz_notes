	- set a deadline that would let you achieve a rational conclusion on wether you should commit to something or not.

	Hi [@Jamie Fenner](https://www.skool.com/@4cdfc7d20cfd4eef89484c357ce6c0da?g=synthesizers)!
	
	I had a few thought while reading your post that might help you…
	
	1) Before I start something new, I like to set a goal of how long I need do it before I’m allowed to give up.
	
	- For my YouTube channel, I decided to make 100 videos before I would consider stopping (I’m at 74 now and will definitely not stop at 100 but it took me at least 25 videos until it started being fun)
	- For my podcast, I decided to create one full season of 10 interviews and then reconsider whether I want to do another season (I’m currently editing those 10 interviews to release later this month and will most likely do another season)
	
	2) My business professor likes to say that ideas are worth nothing. Anyone can have great ideas. The only thing that will matter is execution. In fact, you’re far better off starting with bad idea and implementing it and improving it than starting with a good idea and stopping after two weeks.
	
	3) If you want to achieve something, you cannot rely on motivation. Motivation will always be up and down. Especially in the beginning when things are the toughest because everything is new and you don’t know what you’re doing, there’s no way you will feel enough motivation to get to the other side. You have to shift your identity to “someone who does X” and then put it in your calendar and do it whether you feel like it or not.
	
	Finally, a question for you:
	
	What is your goal with creating content? Why do you want to make something? Where do you want to be a few years down the line?
	
	It’s completely fine to see it as a hobby and just do whatever is most fun to you right now. But if that’s not enough for you (which your post kind of implies) then it’s time to treat it as a business.
