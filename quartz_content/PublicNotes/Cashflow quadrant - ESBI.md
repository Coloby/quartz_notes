- Evaluations
	- analysis & what sorted by Freedom evaluation ASC
		- E - get a job 
			- the one where you got the least freedom on
				- when you work
				- where you work
				- what you work on
				- why you work
				- income
			- kind of get stability
		- S - has a job
			- free - where
			- non free - why - idk the real intent of the client nor stop him after
			- hard to gain
				- when, stability & what - more income more freedom on those
					- meno difficile del B perch√® 
						- se vai sotto ci vai solo tu invece che un'intera azienda
				- what - if client want changes you can't say no
					- apart when you pick the contract yourself and client doesn't need stuff you wouldn't like
				- income - you can use persuasion, marketing etc
				- stability
		- B - has a system
			- free - why - what
			- hard to gain
				- stability
				- when
				- income
				- where
		- I - has money
			- free - what, when, where, why, stability
			- hard to gain
				- income
	- evaluation sorted by general value ASC
		- E 
			- experience u get
				- steal the way they train you in a 9/5 and implement it yourself
				- teamwork
				- possibly leadership
				- design, sales
			- compared to others long term
				- usually the hardest way to get financial freedom
				- while gaining financial freedom you'll have the least freedom 
			- may be needed to get in-place experience
		- S
			- evaluated to the others in long term
				- all problems are fixable
				- while gaining financial freedom you'll have less freedom than if you had choose "B" || "I"
		- B - even though it's very hard the outcome may be essential to go to "I"
			- being a business owner let you understand how to evaluate them when investing
		- I - best scenario
	- Taxes
		- ![[Pasted image 20230903054131.png]]
- My strategy
	- what I know for sure
		- I hate being in "E"
		- I need "I" for passive income
	- principles
		- "Truths"
			- you can't go to I and B before having *money* or *knowledge*. 
			- If you go directly to I before B you'll have some problems
				- you would probably come from S at this point and paying mentors while being in S would mean less quality mentors because you can invest only so much and not many money to make errors. 
					- You know that you would need a buffering of money and time and you won't have with S
					- B you would get many advanced practical skills that you'll need to take into account when being and I don't think that mentors can really learn you everything
			- skipping E may be suitable for self learning individuals
		- Find a way to get the initial spike of value brought by initial money + sustained paid learning
		- try the whole ESBI to get holistic experience
		- you don't know the future but try to predict as much as possible to don't get fkd
