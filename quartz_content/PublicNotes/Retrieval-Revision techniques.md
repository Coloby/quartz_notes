- Sorted by quality

- Strategy - Use all of them togheter apart from active recall 
	 - Why active recall is overestimated
		 - you kind of use the inquiry method to better recall but compared to others this seems dull because you don't find new knowledge you just write it in the shape of a question and I can't remember questions because they seem mostly isolated to me, expecially if they're not part of the 5W's and 1H. Free recall is more cognitive demanding and less time consuming thus my preferred choice over active recall
- Techinques
	- Spaced repetition - repeat it with growing gap of time
		- Sporadically needed with great encoding
		- Fights the decay of the forgetting curve trough [[Retrieval-Revision techniques]]
	- [[Interleaving]]
	- wPw - Whole part whole - teach by reverse engineering
		1. Reveal the final result
		2. Disectionate it to understand how the components relate to each other to embody the final result
		3. Make the final product again
	- Feyman method - teach info in a simple manner
		1. Explain to someone in the most simple way
		2. Identify what you can't explain and learn it again
		3. Repeat until you gain a simple but complete explanation
	- Free recall - trying to recall info without peeking

	- Less effective	
		1. Active recall - to me free recall is better - trying to recall info without peeking but with prompts
			- often paired w flashcards
			- e.g.
			- porsi delle domande sull’argomento e saper rispondere;
			    - Cos'ho appena letto?
			    - Quali sono le idee di base?
			    - Posso spiegarlo con parole mie?
			- svolgere gli esercizi se è una materia scientifica.
			- ripetere ad alta voce dopo che si è letto un paragrafo o un capitolo;
	
		2. Flash cards - [mostly a last resort](https://youtu.be/ckPVBw_CBJk?t=216)
			- to remember details that we can't really remember using your Tidy brain workflow
