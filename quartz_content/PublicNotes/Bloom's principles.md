- Bloom's taxonomy - all is sorted by importance - [fonte](https://youtu.be/VcT8puLpNKA?t=243)
	- With "info" most of the time I'm referring to past knowledge and THEN about the topic itself
	1. Create - innovating trough [[Problem solving]] and steps below
	2. [[Predicting]] "PACE"- Make conclusions with [[Critical thinking]]
		- Predict - w [[Holistic thiking]]
		- Aurgument - trough fallacies & inconsistency to destroy [[HT Aurgument]]
		- [[Creativity]] - think with the unknown
		- Evaluate - if it is, why is more important & how compared to other info? [e.g](https://youtu.be/Mvxbl7Iwep4?t=1164)
	3. Analyze "CRED" - understanding on a-steroids
		- [[Chunking]]
		- Relate
		- Extract - succint keypoints & abstraction (patterns) to discover new info
		- Differentiate - similarities & differences

	-
	- *Extended abstract* - Relational + connections within different fields
	- *Relational* - Multistructural + connections within the same field
	- low level
		- Multistructural - multiple keypoints
		- Unistructural - only know one keypoint
		- Prestructural - isolated and ununderstood
