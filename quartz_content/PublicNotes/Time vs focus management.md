- Differences with time management:
	- pros
		- creates a framework based on results rather than time
			- You feel bad when you don't achieve a goal and not because you didn't spent x time on the task
		- you train your brain to think before doing your next task
		- no need to create a table to predict something that human nature can't really predict, time
	- cons
		- you may have problems prioritizing, missing important tasks because you're too focussed on other ones
		- you lose the benefith of respecting a deadline
- takeoff
	- don't use just one but rather go for a balanced approach that suits your needs and use the strenghts of each method
		- e.g.
			- do most work in morning like 3h and 
			- then put time limit to when you should be forced to continue the rest of the work like 2h
