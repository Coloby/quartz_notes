If that's so, isn't one of the best ways to solve a problem solving it backwards and then evaluating the soltions? you come with ideas looking at the big picture (divergent) then you evaluate those in more detail (convergent) then you re-evaluate ideas coming up with other ones (divergent) and then you re-evaluate this refining process (convergent)
