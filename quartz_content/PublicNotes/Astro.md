- what? [Brief explanation](https://youtu.be/rRxuVOutmFQ)
	- rendering strats supported natively
		- CSR
		- SSG
		- SSR
		- PPR
- why? 
	- conclusions
		- n1 reason to use astro is PPR & performance w Partial Hydration but Next.js 14 introduced PPR as experimental so eventually we'll have it too + partial hydration it's double edge sword 
		- even though animations & support for md it's great those are the only 2 reasons I may use astro
		- other than for smaller projects, I would not use this + you still need to learn it while next.js can do the same stuff (apart from PPR) even if w a different dx experience
		- next.js seem to have a future, not sure about astro + still has small community
	- n
		- Doesn't have as much features/community/third-party-pkgs as next.js
			- it mostly have feats you can find on next.js anyway
				- image optimization
				- SSG
			- it's new so small ecosystem
		- React is still not fully supported
			- you can't use 
				- React hooks
		- Not suited for webapps and large scale applications
			- still too young & not tested
			- state management can be a tricky dx bcs of the Partial Hydration
	- Partial Hydration it's a double edge sword but core of astro phylosophy
		- compatibility with pkgs that expect a fully hydrated env may give unexpected results
		- you can disable it in a per component basis but there is no option to disable it entirely
	- y
		- you may still go with client side only hydration (experimental 01/Jan/2024)
			- even though Partial Hydration it's still the focus
			- `<Counter client:only />`
			- when this will be out of *experimental* phase we'll be able to fully use react feats and not having as many problems when passing state among components
		- stuff that next.js can't replicate *as easily*
			- animating
			- use of md files by default
				- 04/Mar/2024 now it doesn't seem so hard with next.js 14
				- Great for static data - like simple blogs - [aurgumentation](https://youtu.be/BoeZqPaYw9s?t=23)
		- ui framework agnostic
			- you may use vue, preact, angular in the same codebase
