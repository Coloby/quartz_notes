### Models
#### Great ones
1. Free [[Freelance]] to ROI agency w oversea contractor arbitrage
	- what? summary 
		1. [[Freelance]] with a skill that you can translate to an offer
		2. Make systems to streamline your offer and biz
		3. "Hire" someone to work with the system you created, and take margins on his work
		4. Focus on sales and how to delegate further
		5. Develop a better offer (like ROI) and **funnel**
	- How?
		- Prerequisites
			- [[Learning in Public]] getting ready 4 [[One-person biz model]]
				- document your process & publicize it trough videos blogs etc 
			- choose 
			- The offer (product/service)
			- [[Niche market]] trough [[Introspection]] etc
		- Freelance providing your service free and then monetize it 
			- Your pay are reviews at the start.
				- Build authority through great work, and start asking money only after (like 3 projects). 
				- continue to ask more and more until you reach problems you'll need to solve.
			- Develop the skills to manage people
			- e.g.
				- work for people for free without permission
		- Get contractors (or hire if you really trust)
			- some oversea contractors are better and cheaper
			- train/mentor them using ur system refined w freelancing
			- find them 
				- posting on paid programs (of the service you sell) private facebook groups 
					- contact admin to get your post in there (it's in their best intrests)
			- Disclouse how much money they're not getting 4 trust
		- Find them clients through [[Sales]] & [[Marketing]]
		- Demonstrate to our clients the ROI
			- we give clients more money than the ones we are asking from them (because we really do)
			- disclouse w analytics or logical stuff
				- like why thumbnails can be high return on investment
	- why this work?
		- Clients don't need to employee your contractors
			- no benefits, no paperwork, less responsability
		- Clients trust the agency, not the single contractor
			- An agency of contractors is more trustable than just a single contractor/freelancer
		- Clients have a clear idea on why it works 
			- The offer is solid because clients know excatly how much money are they spending and gaining from you.
	- why it doesn't?
		- Critics - [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmifdio65kI) - you need to learn what you delegate to...
			- make and refine system around it 
				- [[Project organization strategies]]
			- sell it better 
			- validate work and employees w quality standards
			- set expectations 
				- time wise to let clients know 
				- proj management
				- employee skill
			- talk about the offer with sales calls, emails, etc
				- [Needed to ask client to convert lead but client answered too late](https://youtu.be/Z_dFih4-Koo?t=281)
				- [Got exposed for not being as expert as it seemed](https://youtu.be/0J4iqgsxBJQ?t=174)
			- identify challenges & opportunities
			- to deliver/help contractors for emergencies
				- mantain a client giving consistent quality results
		- Archived
			- old question I asked
				- I should delegate fulfillment in a web design agency, but:
					 -  Will sales be more difficult for one that didn't really do fulfillment himself or know the skill?
					  - How can I validate the skills and quality of work of the contractor?
					  what if the contractor suddently ghost me?
					Context: I'm a total beginner and probably overthinker, [this video](https://youtu.be/Dmifdio65kI) explain each of my points much better   
		- oversea contractors problems
			- Timezone + potential language barriers
			- clients expectations
				- may not expect subcontracting even though u are a CONTRACTOR AGENCY
				- Ethical considerations - some people think it's exploitation

	- How?
		- [Advice on skool](https://www.skool.com/adonis-gang/i-have-5-true-fans-what-do-i-sell?p=49a9fb28)
			- Focus on getting 5 people that trust you, make them try your product (even for free), gain feedback, build a better product, sell at scale
	- Examples
		- courses
		- art
		- private communities
#### 2 choices
- affiliate marketing - marketing to sell other people stuff, amzn do fullfillme
	- fonte [ali abdal](https://youtu.be/M5y69v1RbU0?t=876)
- [[Coaching]]/Tutoring/Mentoring
- [[Investing]]
-
- franchising
	- buy
	- make
		- Same product & services
		- Fees & Royalties
		- training
			- Franchisees receive training and support in implementing the franchisor's business systems, processes, and standards.
- e-commerce - sell anything at your own discretion
	- what?
		- owning a marketplace where you can sell your stuff and others
	- the platform
		- start - shopify or etsy are preferred for less initial cost
		- long term - custom e-commerce for no fees and full control

#### Less good
- more info
	- sorted by relevancy or how probable it's you doing it
	- the stuff you do is after the "-" unless it's written "they"
	- fullfillment
		- the process by which the product is delivered to the customer without any significant delay or problems
			- inventory
			- packing and Quality Control
			- delivery to client and logistics
				- tracking and tracing
				- customer support and Refunds

- SMMA - SocialMediaMarketingAgency
	- [iman](https://youtu.be/px8iVQtiJbo?t=2154) says to never go below 60% profit margin
	- I don't even like social media
		- Sometimes we need to take tradeoffs and compromise to get the right means to an end. Socials are powerful and we still provide positive influence anyway. 
			- If an angel sell bread in hell it doesn't mean it's not an angel anymore
- Copywriting/ghostwriting
- remote seller/appointment setter - [fonte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLkFH3ffpBY)
	- what?
		- getting employed... to try to schedule sales calls for your boss or to make them yourself and then getting a percentage (usually 4% or low in general) out of positive sales calls
	- why? a way to maybe get mentored while learning sales
- Credit card churning
	- what
		- optimizing bonuses and cashbacks of credit cards etc like the new customer bonus trough the MSR - minimum spend requirement
	- problem
		- you really need to put your nose in the books to try to get as many money as possible going trough the edge of issuers regulations 

- Dropshipping - buy when client ask while supplier do fullfillment
	- You tell the supplier (agency that assemble your product) to craft it the way you want and set a wholesale price
	- When a customer buy you buy the product at the wholesale price but sell it with the price you decided to put let's say on ali-express
	- shipping times depends on the supplier
- Amz *FBA* - amzn inventory, pack and ship your physical product
	- you send the *already bought* product to amazon warehouses where they store the product until it's sold and then they deliver it
	- it's like investing because you need to buy the product before sending it to amz
- Amz Handmade - supporter service dedicated to "crafters"
	- gives tools to customize the product for the customer and to craft a better deal
- Amz Multi-Channel Fulfillment *MCF* - amzn mng fullfillme from your stores
	- if you seel from multiple platforms amazon connects to them and handles the fullfillment 

- Amz Seller-Fulfilled Prime *SFP* - inventory, packing and prime shipping
	- but you get your product to show on amazon and pay a fee for that
	- need to meet certain performance criteria set by Amazon
- Amz Merchant Fulfilled Network *MFN* - SFP without prime & criterias to meet
- Self-Fulfiller - you manage all fullfillment without third parties
	- no amazon, ali express tos services to respect
