“hey [first-name, if you can’t find the owner’s name use their company name] I saw you guys didn’t have a website so I actually made one for you, and I actually want to give this website to you guys for free, all I'm looking for is a video testimonial. Here’s a loom of me showing you the site."

Hey [name] my name's Karim, you don't know who I am, but I wanted to make this website for you. For full transparency, I'm a 13 year old kid who wants to help other people get into the gym and improve their lives, and making this website for you achieves that. That's it about me, lemme walk you through the site, I hope you like it.

Also make sure to not actually make the website live, just show them the Figma design you made, you'd be spending way too much time on each video if you actually make each website live.

"Hey can i speak to [name], we we're texting each other on [platform]. If they say he/she's not here, then arrange a time to speak in the DMs and let them know that you called them. Don't bother asking the gatekeeper any questions.

So after you've finished the making the website, call them or make a loom with a proposal for them for website maintenance. I charged $50/month for my client (translates to around $60 Canadian dollars)

Website maintenance is only the first upsell though. Eventually I want to upsell on SEO as well (search engine optimization) SEO can range from $500/month to $2500/month, and it's about 10-20 hours of work/month depending on the price.

Soon after you get a couple video testimonials you can start charging for the sites at $1000 to $5000.
