- Sources to learn sorted by "objective" quality
	- [[Pragmatism]] testing
		- Usually it should not be the first method you use
			- [[Mentor]]s may guide you preventing you to make useles mistakes, but still makes you train on the field after doing so
		- only worth it when...
			- preparation has been needed and made
				- there might be mistakes that are destructive and should be prevented
				- if the topic it's somethink like cooking there's not much preparation needed because mistakes might not be as crucial 
			- if you fail, the lesson you'll learn will be *really* valuable
	- facts vs opinions - empirical data (higher/lower level)
		- take care of [[Biases and Fallacies]] w [[Critical thinking]] and you'll find something really close to the truth
	- Your mind - never underestimate youself
		- Past knowledge - process&update to the new one - *regularely*
		- Present situation/life - as a chess board w [[Predicting]]
			- Resources
			- Risks
	- Relationships - People
		- [[Mentor]] & reverse mentor + [[Relationships]], not advisors 
			- Any other category might not did/make what you want to make, **mentors did instead**, they have experience
			- it's a combination of tutoring, coaching, and consulting
			- holistic specialized supportive role. "Best" one usually
		- Tutoring - specific for skill/offer dev + like a teacher
		- Coaching - holistic & focussed on broad goal obtaining
			- Only if mentorship is off radar & already know skill/offer
		- Consulting - practical tutoring but less teaching
			- oriented on solving the problem for/with the client rather than teaching
			- like someone that do your same stuff, but is better than you.
			- He doesn't teach like a tutor, but he has practical knowledge.
			- useful when feeling comfortable on the theory but lacking the practical and holistic implementation 
		- Community&Masterminds - great support for any situation
			- networking serendipity
			-
			- your own - start ASAP, make it a mastermind ASAP
				- then you can make it public/general for traffic
			- private - 
				- less quantity but more quality people than public
					- specific interests
					- commitment
					- masterminds
					- collaboration
			- public 
				- to prepare/validate yourself for private ones
				- Diversity: broad point of views
				- Wider range of resources
				- Serendipity, potential collaboration, visibility 
					- because of more people
					- it's better here to...
						- promote
						- make big events
						- gather feedback
						- send free educational content
						- Recruit asking for specific individuals
		-
		- My evaluation 
			- Mentor - best choice bcs it has the best of everything
			- Tutoring - problems specifically with the offer or skill
			- Coaching - only after having the offer or the skill
			- Consulting - don't need a teacher, but a problem solver
			- Community -  needed/useful in any scenario
		- connect the dots - holicism
		- Great [resource](https://youtu.be/tHTaIDRVI7E)
			- mentor, peer, mentoree, and why private communities are important
