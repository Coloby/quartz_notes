		- Problem
			- you won't find a job as a frontend dev even if you're skilled because "it would be a risk for our agency tacking someone without experience" and even if they do they will threat you hurshly and ask for the algorythm interview that would take at least 2 extra months
		- Solutions
			- follow the roadmap but threat it as long term one and look for which job you're elegible for every step of the way based on your current skill level to get experience, reviews, credibility, needed and vast set of skills and a desirable portfolio for recruiters
		- In depth
			- take low entry but related jobs 
				- like e-mail dev and product editor
				- freelancing
				- [searching html on indeed](https://youtu.be/UC9YeWscC2M?t=1302)
				- look career paths in [his website](https://codingphase.com/) or buy he's course
				- use [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) to check which job you're elegible for
