- why? to make high importancy stuff first
- how? setting task importancy by categorization & hiearchy like to-do list + rules
	- Always do stuff based on priority and re-schedule the others
		- can't do p1 until urgent & MIT has been done
	- sort by importancy only when you ended prev importancy category
	- tasks categories
		- put a Discovery section into the category note with the task.
			- if you're gonna need to know more about something chances are you're going to look at your past knowledge anyway and if not then it's logical to think that you may have putten something useful for yourself in the future
