title: Welcome to my digital garden!
description: There you can find my .md notes :)
---

- My personal website: https://edondigital.vercel.app
	- no soul-less portfolio, and here you can find most stuff about me
- This website is open source: https://github.com/Coloby/quartz_notes
	- you can also download my notes that link
-
- What is this?
	- Sharing your digital notes on the internet is a practice called [digital gardening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDqsr3MNTTc). That's what I'm doing with this website
- Why?
	- Serendipity and many other stuff I still need to write in this section
	- Please [contact me](https://edondigital.vercel.app/contact) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edondigital) or wherever you like to have a chat
- Disclaimers - These notes are made for me first
	- That's why you might not understand them, they're not really for the public but are still shared
	- Don't take everything I write as truth. I know that I write pretty crazy stuff, just don't believe them without thinking first
	- Most images doesn't work for now, [contact me](https://edondigital.vercel.app/contact) if you want it to be fixed for a specific note
	- I'm bilingual so if you find Italian stuff, too bad for you. 90% Of these notes are english anyway

- Helpful notes to make sense of my vault
	- fonte = source
		- I'm mentioning the source of a particular topic
	- discovery
		- you'll find this list on top of files. Its items are useful resources to go deeper into the note's topic
	- archived
		- stuff I no longer count as relevant but are there just because I don't want to delete them
	- why don't you use headings?
		- I hate them. They take too much space, have strange behaviors when folding stuff, and take too much brain power to make them (##### = heading 5)
		- just fold the lists and here you go, you have "headings"
	- why do you have only a public folder?
		- I'm lazy, I organize notes through connections, not folders
-

	- more info
