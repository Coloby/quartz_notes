## Overview

### what is this?
My digital garden, or the notes that I want to share with the internet.

To do it, I'm using [Quartz V4](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), a static-site generator. The default configuration works like a charm, especially if you already like obsidian.

The tool is from [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0) but the modifications and notes are from [Ed](https://edondigital.vercel.app/about), the creator of this repo.

### why?

It was only 20 minutes of setup, and it's SO COOL. 

I'm too lazy to list the hundreds of benefits, just watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDqsr3MNTTc) to get an idea.
